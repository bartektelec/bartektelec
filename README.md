## Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I am a Front-end developement student based in Oslo, Norway.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript and Node.js

- 🪐 You can see my progress on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/profiles/bartektelec) where I learn algorithms in TypeScript
- 🎞 Check out an [app](https://bartektelec.github.io/react-netflix-clone/) I made using React, styled-components, storybook and The MovieDB REST API
